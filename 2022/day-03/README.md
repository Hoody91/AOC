# Day 3 

For this solution I have used the experimental [Array Chunks](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/struct.ArrayChunks.html) API and therefore until this feature is stabilized it will need to be ran with the nightly toolchain. 

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
```
```bash
cargo +nightly run --bin part-1
```
```bash
cargo +nightly run --bin part-2
```
